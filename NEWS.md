# sppt 0.2.2

* Minor updates to code to ensure compatibility with dplyr 1.0.0 and higher.

# sppt 0.2.1

* Added checks for SpatialPolygons and SpatialPoints objects. For the spatial
  units of analysis, SpatialPolygons can now be used as they are automatically
  coerced to SpatialPolygonsDataframe. If provided objects are not of type
  SpatialPolygons or SpatialPoints, functions stop and give error message.

# sppt 0.2.0

## Important changes

* Function `sppt_diff()` changed to have "Chi2_Nmin1" as the default test. This
  means that a function call to `sppt_diff()` will give different results than
  the same call up to version 0.2.0, as the latter had "Yates" as default.

* Function `sppt_diff()` updated to have a variety of tests.

* Function `sppt_diff()` now uses the p-values throughout (instead of confidence 
  intervals) to decide on statistical significance. This makes it easy to adjust
  the p-values (and decisions to reject the null) for multiple comparisons,
  the default setting.

* Function `sppt_diff()` no longer uses exact2x2 package as fisher.test reports
  the same p-value (only the confidence intervals were different, which are no
  longer used.)
  
* Arguments of `sppt_boot()` changed. Instead of 'replacement' now 'bootstrap'
  is used. 'percpoints' default is set to 85, but is ignored if bootstrap = TRUE.
  This means that in the default behavior, a bootstrap sample (i.e. 100% of
  points are samples with replacement) is drawn for both Base and Test. If
  bootstrap = FALSE, the percpoints (default 85) is used in a subsampling method
  for both Base and Test (i.e. as in Andresen's original test, but also for Base).

* Added argument 'bootstrap' to `sppt()`. In the default behavior, bootstrap =
  FALSE and `sppt()` will be Andresen's original test (i.e. subsampling Test
  only with percpoints sampling without replacement). When bootstrap = TRUE,
  'percpoints' is ignored and a bootstrapped sample (i.e. 100% of Test points
  sampled WITH replacement) is used for Test.

## Misc

* Vignette sppt renamed into sppt_intro

* Vignette sppt_diff updated with new information.

* LICENSE file added

* README updated

# sppt 0.1.6

* Adjusted function `sppt_diff()` to use `exact2x2::exact2x2()` instead
  of `stats::fisher.test` as the former matches the different two-sided 
  conditional exact tests for 2x2 tables with the appropriate confidence 
  intervals. See https://cran.r-project.org/package=exact2x2 for details.

* Added information on the `exact2x2::exact2x2()` to vignette
  'Proportion difference tests'.

* README updated

* Moved helper functions such as `summary.sppt()` to separate R file.

# sppt 0.1.5

## New features

* New function `sppt_diff()` added. This function calculates the difference
  in proportions between Base and Test points using standard 'proportion
  difference' tests. Having zero points in an areal unit will not lead to
  a confidence interval of 0% to 0% (as in `sppt()` and `sppt_boot()`),
  making is a more conservative test. See Wheeler, A., Steenbeek, W., &
  Andresen, M.A. (2018). Testing for Similarity in Area-Based Spatial Patterns:
  Alternative Methods to Andresen's Spatial Point Pattern Test.
  (SSRN: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111822)

* New function `sppt_boot()` added. This is a full bootstrapping procedure
  to measure the difference in proportions between Base and Test points. In
  contrast to the original `sppt()`, the results of the test are not dependent
  on which dataset is selected as Base and which is selected as Test.

## Misc

* Changed README.md and vignettes to facilitate easier building of vignettes on 
  local machine.
  

# sppt 0.1.4

* First published version of the `sppt` package. Includes function `sppt()`.
