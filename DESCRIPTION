Description: This is a point pattern test that measures the degree of 
    similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns 
    and is an area-based test.
    This spatial point pattern test is not for the purpose of testing 
    point patterns with the null hypotheses of random, uniform, or 
    clustered distributions, but may be used to compare a particular 
    point pattern with these distributions. One advantage of the test 
    is that it can be performed for a number of different area boundaries 
    using the same original point datasets.
