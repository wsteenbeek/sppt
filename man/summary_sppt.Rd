\title{A convenience function to output S-values}
\usage{
summary_sppt(sppt.sp)
}
\arguments{
\item{sppt.sp}{the spatialobject generated by the \code{sppt} function}
}
\value{
returns the standard and robust global S-values
}
\description{
This function takes as input a spatial object generated by the \code{sppt} function
and returns the standard global S-value and the robust global S-value in a list. The standard
global S-value refers to the mean of all local \code{similarity} values (i.e.,
the percentage of areas with a similar proportion of test points as compared to the base points.)
The robust global S-value refers to the mean of all robust local \code{similarity}
values. The robust global S-value is the percentage of areas with a similar proportion
of test points as compared to the base points, not counting areas in which no points
occur in both the base data and the test data.
